Hello and welcome to Wizard Duel the most
prestige tournament for all magic users!
#
I see you are new here but no worries.
I´m going to show you how everything works! 
#
First let´s walk around a bit. For that
press both trigger buttons and swing your
#
hands up and down. You will walk into 
the direction you are facing.
#
Now to the magic part: To open me press your
left trigger key. You will see all the spells 
#
you can use at the moment. On the left is a
description and on the right page is the magic
#
form to cast the spell.Now if you want to
perform the magic on the page, press the
#
right trigger button and draw the shape on the
page into the air. If you replicated the shape
#
well enough two different things can happen:
If it´s a spell which you have to shot at your
#
target, a magic circle is going to appear.
To shoot the projectile press the right trigger
#
button and push your wand throu the center of
the circle. The angle in which you pierce
#
the circle results in the direction of the spell.
Now you can try to shoot it at your practice doll
#
There are also spells that affect passivly.
The second spell in your book increases
#
your walking speed for a few seconds. You don´t 
have to aim the spell, you can just cast it!
#
If you feel ready step into the green portal
and face your first oponent!
